To run the provided Java project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Set Up Your Development Environment
Install Java Development Kit (JDK):

Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed. You can download it from the Oracle website or use OpenJDK.
Install Maven:

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. You can download it from the Maven website and follow the installation instructions.
Set Up Your IDE:

Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code. These IDEs support Maven and make it easier to manage and run Java projects.
2. Create Project Structure
Create the Project Directory:

Create a directory for your project. Inside this directory, create the src folder structure as described previously.
Create Files:

Create the Java files and pom.xml as described.
3. Build and Run the Project
Open the Project in Your IDE:

Open your IDE and import the project as a Maven project. Most IDEs have an option to import projects using the pom.xml file.
Build the Project:

Maven handles dependencies and builds the project. You can build the project using the following Maven command in your IDE's terminal or command line:
mvn clean install
This command cleans any previous builds and installs the dependencies defined in the pom.xml.

Run the Application:
In your IDE, locate the AutomatedTuningApp class and run it. Most IDEs provide a "Run" option when you right-click the file or have a run button if you open the file in the editor.

Alternatively, you can run the application from the command line:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.yourcompany.AutomatedTuningApp"

Ensure that the exec-maven-plugin is added to your pom.xml:

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
            <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.6.0</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>java</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
            <configuration>
                <mainClass>com.yourcompany.AutomatedTuningApp</mainClass>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>

4. Run Tests
Run Tests with Maven:
To run the tests defined in AutomatedTuningAppTest, use the following Maven command:
mvn test
